# Core Library

The Core Library is deveoped by Prof. [Chee Yap](http://cs.nyu.edu/cs/faculty/yap/) and his students at New York University. It is a collection of C++ classes to support numerical computations that have a variety of precision requirements. In particular, it supports the Exact Geometric Computation (EGC) approach to robust algorithms.
