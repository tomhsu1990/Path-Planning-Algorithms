Oct 2010:
  Narayan implemented various aspects of complex number type,
  and complex polynomials.  These are found under progs/mesh
  (esp.benchmark).  These should be transferred here for general use.

Dec 21, 2006: 
  We implemented Descartes method, intended to
  replace Sturm.  But strangely Descartes is slower
  than Sturm for our basic tests (under poly/tSturm* and
  poly/tDescartes*).  Perhaps there are some optimizations
  for Descartes that we missed.
